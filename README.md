For any newly opened online store validation is a hard problem to solve: without validation clients might not buy products suggested there. But what if user is in doubt of buying a product, and a guy next to him comes and purchases 5 items of the same product user is considering to buy?

That’s what we solve with **ShopWindow chat**. **ShopWindow chat** shows other users activity on an ecommerce website, just like it happens in any real store. Even if user is not sure whether they are real or not, he can just chat with them, ask for advice or comments. They’re as real as you! And the best, **ShopWindow chat** is always next to your shopping cart, so you can read any conversation while shopping, or even join it. Not sure what to buy? Just ask other people like you!

**ShopWindow app**, which is smartphone interface of our project, turns any ecommerce website into a social experience, where any visitor can see how other users behave and can contact them just like in the real world, but in a chat window.

### Inspiration

Thinking about alternative experience, we considered a lot of different concepts: from shopping by mood or image to chatbots and bargaining. But the idea we liked most was born when we tried to transfer offline shopping experience into web.

Offline, once a person enters the store, s/he can start dialogue with anyone around, including salesmen: for casual talk, or to ask for opinion, help, or even spot what other people are buying. Web didn’t have such opportunities. Till now.

### Idea

We are suggesting Shopify module + Android app which allows every visitor to see what other online users are doing at the moment in a store.Emulating offline experience, it would give visitors more confidence in product choices. Every user can start conversation with others, or just make conclusions based on activity.

### How we built it

After brainstorming for ideas, we assigned tasks for everyone:

* **Roberto** had experience in Firebase and Shopify, so he consulted team on implementation of these technologies. Being an Android developer, he also worked on Android client, also connecting it with Firebase.

* **Marcelo** worked on front-end of website, creating and implementing chat itself, which included close work with Shopify API and Firebase.

* **Dein** set up a Shopify store.

* **Anastasia** worked on planning user experience which would be tightly connected with chat, creating interfaces for the store, and once everything was done, on presenting results of team’s work.

### Challenges we ran into

1. Connection of chat and Shopify.
2. Building the whole user experience around communication between users. At this step we had to revise our concept after 24 hours of work on the project. We made sure user receives all possible benefits from this type of shopping.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

We managed to develop a completely new shopping experience for a user, and to create 2 fully working MVP in 48 hours: Shopify module and Android application.

All our team members live in different timezones, yet we managed to set up a very productive process of development, where every team member knew exactly what to do. We are proud of our harmonious work in spite of the distance.

### What we learned  

We learned a lot about Shopify API, Firebase integration.

### What's next for our shopping chat

If we had a chance, it would be great to go deeper into integration and develop security settings which could allow users not only to hide their usernames, but also to choose what activities they prefer to share.

Implementing a chat bot into this chat to answer basic user’s questions seems to us beneficial for a user.

One more possible feature for our product would be public user profile where other visitors could see buyer experience (history of purchases or just categories where user has more experience).
